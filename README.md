# Apache NiFi - Processor for Apache Pulsar

## How to build

To build the NAR files using Maven, just run the following commands. The first one makes sure that you are using Java 
version 21, which is necessary since NiFi 2.x uses this version.

```
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21`
mvn clean package
```

This will also generate a Docker image inside your local docker daemon with the tag `streamnative/nifi`

*Note: Currently, this command will load NAR files that were build using the default NiFi, Pulsar, and Java versions
into the lib folder of the NiFi container for testing. Therefore, if you need to test artifacts built using a
different version of these libraries, then you will first need to copy those NAR artifacts into the docker/lib folder *BEFORE* building
the Docker image.

## How to test

A Dockerfile has been included in the project that can be used to test the Processor locally, and can be started with the following command:

```
docker run --name nifi -d -p 8443:8443 \
-e SINGLE_USER_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME=admin \
-e SINGLE_USER_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD=ctsBtRBKHRAx69EqUghvvgEvjnaLjFEB \
streamnative/nifi
```

See the [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/nifi) on the base image for more configuration options

Visit https://localhost:8443/nifi/#/login and enter the username and password you provided in the docker command.

## How to debug

The JVM Debugger can be enabled by setting the environment variable NIFI_JVM_DEBUGGER to any value when running the docker image, e.g.

```
docker run -d --name nifi \
-v /Users/david/Downloads/nifi-test/:/nifi-test
-p 8443:8443 -p 8000:8000 \
-e NIFI_JVM_DEBUGGER=true
-e SINGLE_USER_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME=admin
-e SINGLE_USER_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD=ctsBtRBKHRAx69EqUghvvgEvjnaLjFEB
streamnative/nifi
```
